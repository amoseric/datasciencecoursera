# Project for Practical Machine Learning, 2015 April
#
# Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to 
# collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
# These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of 
# enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their 
# health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One 
# thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they 
# do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will 
# be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 
# 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly 
# in 5 different ways.
#
# This report shows how a model is built to predict "classe, the outcome variable.  
# We will also look at cross validation, the expected out-of-sample error and model 
# choices. Lastly the prediction model is used to predict 20 different test cases. 

# The data for this project come from this source: 
# http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

inTrain = createDataPartition(train$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
trainingSet = train[inTrain,]
validationSet = train[-inTrain,]


# Cleaning up the data:
# Remove the first 7 variables as they are not motion related variables
#
trainingSet = trainingSet[,-(1:7)]
dim(trainingSet)


# Remove variables with near zero variance
#
nzvCol = nearZeroVar(trainingSet)
trainingSet = trainingSet[, -nzvCol]


# Remove variables that have 60% or higher NA values

        unwantedCol[index] = i
    }

# [1] Build CART Model on training set
#
library(rpart)
modCART = rpart(classe ~ ., data = trainingSet, method = "class", 
                  cp = 0.001)

# Training set accuracy using CART Model
#
trainingPredict1 = predict(modCART, data = trainingSet, type = "class")
print(confusionMatrix(trainingPredict1, trainingSet$classe))


# [2] Build Random-Forest Model on training set
# I am using 8 year-old laptop running RF below, so I just choose low but good enough 
# parameters that do not require too high proccessing power
#
library(randomForest)
modRF <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = trainingSet, importance = TRUE, 
                      ntrees = 20, nodesize = 10)

# Training set accuracy using RF Model
#
trainingPredict <- predict(modRF, data = trainingSet)
print(confusionMatrix(trainingPredict, trainingSet$classe))

# Accuracy of validation set (Out of Sample)
#
validationPredict <- predict(modRF, newdata = validationSet)
print(confusionMatrix(validationPredict, validationSet$classe))


# Result:
# Random-Forest Model is preferred over CART Model as it has higher training
# set accuracy: (99.21% vs 91.8%). 
# Using Random-Forest Model, the cross validation accuracy is 99.37% and 
# therefore the expected out-of-sample error is 0.63% (100% - 99.37%).
# This model is selected to predict classe variable in the given test set.


# Prediction on test set
#
testPredict <- predict(modRF, test)
testPredict

# Save answers onto files for later submission
#
pml_write_files = function(x) {
  n = length(x)
  for (i in 1:n) {
    filename = paste0("problem_id_", i, ".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, 
                row.names = FALSE,
                col.names = FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(as.vector(testPredict))
